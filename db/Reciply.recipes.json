Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in the pan over a low heat. Add 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped carrot and 1 finely chopped celery stick",
    "step :2:- Lay the paper circle over the veg, cover and cook for 10 mins or until softened. Remove the lid and paper, increase the heat to medium and stir in 1 tsp tomato purée. Cook for 1 min, stirring, then add 2 tsp plain flour. Mix to combine, then cook for 1 min.",
